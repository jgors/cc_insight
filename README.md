Note:  This is to be run with `python2.7` (not compatable with `python3`)

Also, unit-tests can be run from the root directory of this repo via:

(you would need to install the `nose` python package first with something like pip [1])

`nosetests -s -v`

Of course if not already installed, `pip` might have to be installed as well.


[1] `pip install nose --user --upgrade`
